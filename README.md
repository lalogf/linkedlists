# Data structures

Understanding data structures and the algorithms that may be implemented
on top of them is essential to problem solving with code.

Think of data structures and algorithms as building blocks, like `2+2=4`
in math. Without knowing how to do addition, you are going to have a bad
time. Without knowing how to reason about data structures, your bad time
will translate into failed interviews, and a difficult time reasoning
about more complicated problems.

This repo contains some data structures that we'll learn about in class.
