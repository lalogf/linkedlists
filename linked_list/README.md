# Linked list

The fundamental and easiest data structure to understand is a singly linked
list. If you can understand this data structure, you can understand all
the others. It's like the `2+2` of the data structures world.

* Clone/or fork and clone the repo
* Run `autotest`
* See the tests fail
* Implement `class Node` in `node.rb` and `class LinkedList` in
  `linked_list.rb`
* Work through the tests in order
* Write the tests for the last four methods, and then write the code
